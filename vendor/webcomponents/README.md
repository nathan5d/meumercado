## Installation

To add Phosphor web components to your app via CDN, you can include the following in the `<head>` of the document:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@phosphor-icons/webcomponents@2.0.5"></script>
```

To use within ES modules, install the package and import once near the root of your app:

```bash
yarn add @phosphor-icons/webcomponents
```

or

```bash
npm install --save @phosphor-icons/webcomponents
```

Then

```ts
import "@phosphor-icons/webcomponents";
```

## Usage

Add the custom elements to the document, using the `ph-` prefixed name of the icon as the custom element name:

```html
<body>
  <ph-horse></ph-horse>
  <ph-heart color="crimson" weight="fill"></ph-heart>
  <ph-cube></ph-cube>
</body>
```

### Styling

Icon components can be styled with the following attributes:

- **color?**: `string` – Icon stroke/fill color. Can be any CSS color string, including `hex`, `rgb`, `rgba`, `hsl`, `hsla`, named colors, or the special `currentColor` variable.
- **size?**: `number | string` – Icon height & width. This can be a number (defaults to pixels), or a string with units in `px`, `%`, `em`, `rem`, `pt`, `cm`, `mm`, `in`.
- **weight?**: `"thin" | "light" | "regular" | "bold" | "fill" | "duotone"` – Icon weight/style. Can also be used, for example, to "toggle" an icon's state: a rating component could use Stars with `weight="regular"` to denote an empty star, and `weight="fill"` to denote a filled star.
- **mirrored?**: `boolean` – Flip the icon horizontally. Can be useful in RTL languages where normal icon orientation is not appropriate.
